// A query wrapper is a type to mark whether a query should be run inside a transaction or using only the DB.
//
// When working with concurrent operations, a transaction will fail with the error `pq: unexpected Parse response 'D'`
// this is due to the fact that transactions are not concurrent safe, therefore if a piece of code needs concurrency, it
// should query it's tables in `PureDB` mode, expose/use this flag to control access to the DB. InTx is preferred due to
// it's rollback capabilities.
